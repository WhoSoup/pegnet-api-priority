# PegNet API Priority Determiner

A small tool that attempts to determine a data source priority order that should result in being able to successfully mine in PegNet.

# Setup

The app takes the [default PegNet reference miner configuration](https://github.com/pegnet/pegnet/blob/master/config/defaultconfig.ini), located at the default location: `%HOME%/.pegnet/defaultconfig.ini`. 

* `[Miner].FactomdLocation` sets the location of the factomd endpoint. You can use the open node with this.
* ``
